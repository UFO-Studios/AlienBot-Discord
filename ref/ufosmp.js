Being able to VC is not a requirement.\n3) Be level 5 or over, to gain levels simply chat in the Discord server!\nFor applying run `/ufosmp-apply` command or fill out the form here: https://thealiendoctor.com/UFO-SMP/apply - Please remember UFO SMP is a fan server, for people intersted in the content I make. If you are only here to be able to play on the server, then its probably not the right server for you.\n\nGraves\nThe server has a graves plugin, so when you die your stuff will be placed safely inside a grave. It will also save all of your levels. You can also teleport to your grave (if you don't like this then don't use it...) by using the command /graves. After 30 minutes your grave can be opened by anyone, and after an hour the grave will despawn. Graves will also spawn a zombie once you loot them.\n\nPlugins and Datapacks\nList of plugins: https://thealiendoctor.com/UFO-SMP/plugins\nDatapacks: Vanilla tweaks: https://vanillatweaks.net/share#b33KRn\nVanilla tweaks crafting tweaks: https://vanillatweaks.net/share#KidAbk\nBlaze and Cave's advancement pack: https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/blazeandcave-s-advancements-pack-1-12/"
